PackyTacky
==========

A simple game made in Lua with the Love2D framework (0.9.1).

PackyTacky is a simple 2D game in which the player controls a square shaped character that has to move around and eat red squares to increase the score. There is also an enemy character which looks similar to the player's character but is different in color. He is attracted towards the food. If the enemy character eats the food, the score decreases. If the enemy eats the player character, the game ends.

Please note that this is a work in progress. This is just my implementation of the idea. There is much room for improvement and additions.
